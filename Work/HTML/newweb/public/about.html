        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>University of Cambridge, English autonomous institution of higher learning at Cambridge, 
            Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam 50 miles (80 km) north of London.

The start of the university is generally taken as 1209, when scholars from Oxford migrated to Cambridge 
to escape Oxford’s riots of “town and gown” (townspeople versus scholars). To avert possible troubles, the authorities in Cambridge allowed only scholars under the supervision of a master to remain in the town. It was partly to provide an orderly place of residence that (in emulation of Oxford) the first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugo de Balsham, bishop of Ely. Over the next three centuries another 15 colleges were founded, and in 1318 Cambridge received formal recognition as a studium generale from Pope John XXII.

Cambridge remained fairly insignificant until about 1502, when a professorship of divinity was 
founded—the oldest in the university. In 1511 Desiderius Erasmus went to Cambridge and did much to inculcate 
the new learning of the Renaissance there. In 1546 Henry VIII founded Trinity College (which was and still 
remains the largest of the Cambridge colleges). In 1570 Elizabeth I gave the university a revised body of
 statutes, and in 1571 the university was formally incorporated by act of Parliament. The new statutes, 
 which remained in force for nearly three centuries, vested the effective government of the university in 
 the heads of colleges. Membership of the university was no longer envisaged without membership of a college.
